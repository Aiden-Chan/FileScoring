# FileScoring

This VBA code analyses all text files in a specified folder and reports the ten most frequently occurring words in each one.

	INSTRUCTIONS
1	In the file FileScoring.xlsm, click the 'File Scoring' button in the first sheet
2	Select the folder containing the text files you want to analyse
3	Choose which file type to analyse. At the current stage, only one type can be analysed at a time
4	Choose whether to export the results as PDFs
5	The results will be created in pivot tables in new sheets

  BUILDING
The three .bas files and the one .frm file are already imported into FileScoring.xlsm

  TESTING
Testing should be done by generating text files of suitable content, including characters which may not be considered in the word count (e.g. symbols), with which to test the program. For compatibility purposes this text generation could be done in the same scripting environment as the text analysis code itself.
